      <p>
        The idea of eugenics in the Chrysalids is heavily emphasized through
        religion. Through the thoughts of the main character, David, we are able
        to see what the Waknuk society believes in. In this case, mutants, those
        that look different, are sometimes killed, sterilized, and sent out of
        the area to die. These people are casted out to die, of starvation or
        what we can infer to be nuclear radiation. Keeping society "pure" is the
        main idea in the Waknuk society.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To take this into perspective, lets analyze Adolf Hitler. In the video
        below, we are presented multiple speeches that Hitler gave out
        throughout his life. To summarize, Hitler believed in purity, that there
        can be only one race and to quote "Instill in the minds of our youth the
        knowledge that the jews will be the destruction of mankind." Similar to
        the Waknuk belief that all abnormalities should be sterilized and sent
        out to the fringes, Hitler also believed in purifying his race by mass
        genocide, in which one way was to unleash toxic gas so that everyone in
        the surrounding area would die.

        Towards the end of the story we meet a lady, a Sealander, that wants
        David to keep Petra safe at all costs because of her power. When David
        and the Sealander finally meet, we are told that everyone who was
        fighting, people in the fringes and the Waknuk society, are suffocated
        to death by this weird substance that cocoons people. Comparing this to
        Hitler's mass genocide, "...The place was festooned with threads, which
        appeared more white than glossy now: it took a moment or two of feeling
        something was wrong with them before one perceived that they failed to
        move in the breeze as webs would. And not only they, but everything was
        motionless, petrified." The Sealander states that anyone that comes
        between her race and perfection, dies. She also mentions that someone
        else will come in later and probably wipe out her society, but for now
        she just needs Petra to continue succeeding in her society.
      </p>

      <p>
        This poses the question, will Petra be breeded to produce more of her
        kind (super advanced human being)? Although traditional breeding is not
        considered genetic engineering, in a way the Sealander is breeding to
        better her society; to advance it and to bring purity among the
        telepathic people.

      <p>
        The image illustrates genetic engineering, but in the same way Sealander
        is trying to make a perfect society full of advanced telepaths. Poses
        the thought and comparison of the Sealander being a scientist in a way,
        in terms of genetically shaping her society.

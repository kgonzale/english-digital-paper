          The idea of eugenics in the Chrysalids is heavily emphasized through religion. 
          Through the thoughts of the main character, David, we are able to see what the 
          Waknuk society believes in. In this case, mutants, those that look different, 
          are sometimes killed, sterilized, and sent out of the area to die. These people
          are casted out to die, of starvation or what we can infer to be nuclear radiation.
          Keeping society "pure" is the main idea in the Waknuk society.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          To take this into perspective, lets analyze Adolf Hitler. In the video below, we are 
          presented multiple speeches that Hitler gave out throughout his life. To summarize, 
          Hitler believed in purity, that there can be only one race and to quote "Instill in the
          minds of our youth the knowledge that the jews will be the destruction of mankind." Similar 
          to the Waknuk belief that all abnormalities should be sterilized and sent out to the
          fringes, Hitler also believed in purifying his race by mass genocide.

        <p>
            Towards the end of the story we meet a lady, a Sealander, that wants David to keep
            Petra safe at all costs because of her power. When David and the Sealander finally
            meet, we are told that everyone who was fighting, people in the fringes and the Waknuk
            society, are suffocated to death by this weird substance that cocoons people. The Sealander
            states that anyone that comes between her race and perfection, dies. She also mentions that
            someone else will come in later and probably wipe out her society, but for now she just needs
            Petra to continue succeeding in her society. 
        </p>

        <p>
            This poses the question, will Petra be breeded to produce more of her kind (super advanced 
            human being)? Althought traditional breeding is not considered genetic engineering, in a way
            the Sealander is breeding to better her society. To advance it and to bring purity to the telepathic
            people.

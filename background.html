      <p>
        In this digital project, I wish to pinpoint and compare eugenics along
        with the fear of the unknown with John Wyndham's, the Chrysalids. Why is
        that humans chase perfection at any cost? Why is fear of the unknown so
        intimidating? These are some of the questions I will be trying to tackle
        in this project.

      <h1>What is Eugenics?</h1>
      <hr width="100%" />
      <p>
        From Wikipedia: Eugenics is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to
        improve the genetic quality of a human population by excluding certain
        genetic groups judged to be inferior, and promoting other genetic groups
        judged to be superior. Britannica.com has a similar definition: the
        selection of desired heritable characteristics in order to improve
        future generations, typically in reference to humans. <br /><br />
        The slideshow below aims to depict and show some of the pictures that
        signify eugenics as a whole.

      <h1>The History Behind Eugenics</h1>
      <hr width="100%" />
      <p>
        History.com wrote an
        <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/germany/eugenics">article</a>
        about the influence of Eugenics. To summarize, Plato, a Greek
        philosopher, noted the idea about "creating a society by procreating
        high-class people together and discouraging coupling between the lower
        classes...and incentuous relationships between parents and children were
        forbidden but not between brother and sister." This idea of creating a
        perfect society created the notion for eugenics and set way for other
        people to think alike.<br /><br />
        Charles Darwin, another eugenist, believed to better humankind through
        propagation of the British elite; however, his ideas never spread in his
        own country, it spread in America. In 1896 Connecticut first made it
        illegal to marry someone who has epilepsy or who was "feeble-minded."
        Another example of American eugenics is John Harvey Kellogg, the
        inventor of the Kellogg cereal, who created and organized the Race
        Betterment Foundation, which led conferences on eugenics.<br /><br />
        As we can see, throughout history there has been development on this
        idea of eugenics and creating a society that leads towards perfection,
        so how does that affect us today? Through genetic engineering we are
        creating babies who are born to fit specific needs, those who are
        genetically modified. So what exactly is a negative or positive trait?
        There is no clear distinction and genetic engineering may as well be
        considered eugenics, today.<br /><br />
        The video below does a great job at explaining eugenics throughout the
        course of its existence:

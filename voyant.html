        <h1>Sterilization</h1>
      
        <p>
          Sterilization was one of the main points in the chrysalids. The waknuk society believed in making their 
          society pure, having no imperfections, and if it was found that someone was abnormal they would often
          be sterilized and sent out to the fringes.

        <h1>Genetic/Traits</h1>
      
        <p>
          A huge portion of eugenics throughout history, if not all, has been because of how someone is shaped in terms
          of traits and their genetics. Josef Mengele was part of the disaster in the Holocaust, he was a "doctor" that 
          tested on humans; whether the test was to make the eyes a different color or change something in their body
          (surgery without anesthesia), he was constantly trying to purify and help with Hitler's belief.

        <h1>Society/Race</h1>
      
        <p>
          Moving on to more recent times, the Ku Klux Klan promoted violence and white supremacy, and to do this they often 
          tried to threat the other race (in this case African Americans) and murder them. They wanted to purify and like Hitler
          make their race superior, or better than the other race in this case African Americans.

      <div style="padding-top: 40px;">
        <h1>Movement</h1>
      
        <p>
          In the world I live in today, there is a lot of advancement in technology. This causes some advancement inside of the realm
          of genetic engineering. There are questions on what is considered a good definition of a human because ultimately what scientists
          are doing is trying to create a perfect society.
